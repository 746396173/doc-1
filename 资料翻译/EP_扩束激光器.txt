Laser Beam Expander Description:
Collimated laser beam expander output by increasing the diameter of the beam divergence angle of its compression can make it better collimation, enabling remote use.
Lasers are made of high-quality original, imported laser diode, together with the high performance APC driver circuit and optical coated glass lens group or quality plastic lens plastic composition, with high reliability, high stability, strong anti-interference, good consistency , long life and other characteristics.
Our products are widely used in various industrial testing, long-distance point positioning, laser measuring diameter, interferometer and instrumentation, teaching test light source, laser sighting, laser medical equipment, stage lighting and laser light presentation, laser positioning device.

High-quality laser diode,optical glass lens, driver circuit and housing 
High Transmission 
Short System Length


You have to decrease the beam divergence if the working distance of laser is long. This beam expander laser module series is specially designed for use with red laser. The different expansion ratio can provide a small beam diameter at 10m, 100m even at 1000m. The lens design has considered the correction of spherical aberration in order to get good beam quality at long distance.Other expansion ratio is optional based on your request.
